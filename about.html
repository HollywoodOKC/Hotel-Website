      <h1 id="name">About Hotel California</h1>

      <p id="about-para">Since 1969, the Hotel California has been a West Coast legend.
        Establishing itself as a hotel to be seen and experinced, multiple celebrities have
        thrown parties and held functions here. Once one gets a taste of the H.C., not too
        many can resisit it.

      <p id="about-para">During the 80's, the H.C. went through a overhaul. We added multiple
          new buldings as well as  updated the overall layout. New clothes, same person. The H.C.
          continued to host grand parties and events almost every week during the '80's.
          As our legend grew, so did our guest list. Everyone from Presidents to Grammy winners,
          have experinced the H.C. lifestyle and legend. Join us, you'll never want to leave.

      <p id="about-para">After the hard partying '80's, the H.C. went through several owners
          in the '90's. Finally in the early '00's, the hotel was purchased by a property group
          lead by Mr. Hollywood. With this purchase came the return of the west coast legend.
          When this finished another round of updates, the crowds had to come be apart of our
          special legacy. If you see Mr. Lane, don't be a stranger, he enjoys speaking with
          hotel guest and having a laugh (also a drink).
