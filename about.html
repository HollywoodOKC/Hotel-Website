        <p id="about-para">During the 80's, the H.C. went through a overhaul. We added multiple
          new buldings as well as  updated the overall layout. New clothes, same person. The H.C.
          continued to host grand parties and events almost every week during the '80's.
          As our legend grew, so did our guest list. Everyone from Presidents to Grammy winners,
          have experinced the H.C. lifestyle and legend. Join us, you'll never want to leave.
