    <h1 id="name">About Hotel California</h1>
    <hr>
    <p id="about-para">Since 1921, the Hotel California has been a West Coast legend.
      Establishing itself as a hotel to be seen and experinced, multiple celebrities have
      thrown parties and held functions here. Once one gets a taste of the H.C., not too
      many can resisit it. The hotel had a relatively normal run during it first few decades.
      Nothing of note really took place during this time other than the Goldern Era of movies
      whom many of actor and actresses were present at the H.C. during this time. Also during
      this time was the infamous Vegas Outfit that would visit on weekends to get away from
      the hustle and bustle of Las Vegas. When these guys were in town, everything revolved
      around them and their huge entourages. They always tipped well and partied like the next
      day would not show up.

    <p id="about-para">During the '80s, the H.C. went through a overhaul. We added multiple
      new buldings as well as updated the overall layout. New clothes, same person. The H.C.
      continued to host grand parties and events almost every week during the '80s.
      As our legend grew, so did our guest list. Everyone from Presidents to Grammy winners,
      have experinced the H.C. lifestyle and legend. Join us, you'll never want to leave.

    <p id="about-para">After the hard partying '80s, the H.C. went through several owners
      in the '90s. Finally in the early '00s, the hotel was purchased by a property group
      lead by Mr. Hollywood. With this purchase came the return of the west coast legend.
      When this group finished another round of updates, the crowds had to come be apart of our
      special legacy. If you see Mr. Lane, don't be a stranger, he enjoys speaking with
      hotel guest and having a laugh (also a drink).
